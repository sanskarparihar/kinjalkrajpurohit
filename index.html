    <h1>Yes Its for you Kinjalk</h1>
    <p>
      I am just missing you so much buddy ❤️
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Just a little corner of the internet for you, Some things don’t need a reason. This is one of them.
    </p>
<hr class="soft-line">
<div class="note">
  <p>
    This isn’t meant to explain anything. <br>
    It’s just something I wanted to make — slowly, quietly.
  </p>
<hr class="soft-line">
  <div class="letter">
  <p class="opening">
  I still remember the first day I saw you in our office.
  I knew someone was going to be transferred, but the day you walked in,
  I genuinely thought — so there are real humans in this office after all.
</p>

  <p>In my entire one year at Federal Bank, it was the first time I noticed someone so effortlessly beautiful.<br>
  And honestly, I’m not the kind of guy who walks up and starts conversations easily, especially not with someone who feels completely out of my league.<br>
  Yet somehow, I kept finding excuses — cases, files, work — just to have a few moments of conversation with you.</p>

  <p>When we finally did talk properly, it made me question everything.<br>
  At that time, I was already serving my last two months’ notice period, with the option to revoke my resignation.<br>
  And I remember wondering whether leaving was the right decision at all.</p>

  <p><em>Life, however, had its own plans.</em></p>

  <p>Our entire department shifted to the Tilak Road branch.<br>
  And the day before the shift — the day we had a genuinely good conversation, even if it was about work — I remember feeling quietly happy. It was enough.</p>

  <p><strong>Tilak Road changed everything for me.</strong></p>

  <p>I chose to sit next to you for two reasons.<br>
  One — you were new, and I thought I could be of some help.<br>
  The other — because I wanted to.<br>
  That’s where things truly changed.</p>

  <p>Those days, I felt happier than I ever had in my entire Federal Bank journey.</p>

  <p>There was a day when you weren’t yourself — quiet, distant — and it genuinely affected me.<br>
  Not because you weren’t talking to me, but because the smile and joy that usually lived on your face were missing.<br>
  Even on my way home, I stopped just to text you an apology — not out of guilt, but out of concern.</p>

  <p>Things got better after that.</p>

  <p>When you went to Ujjain for a few days, I missed you more than I expected.<br>
  Those were my last days in the office, and I really wished you were around.<br>
  Still, the calls and messages during that time meant a lot to me.</p>

  <p>The day you came back, I was genuinely happy — because I knew I’d get to see you before leaving.</p>

  <p>And then there was that day — when we stepped out of the office, just the two of us.<br>
  No rush. No crowd. No noise.<br>
  That was the closest I ever felt to you, and it was truly beautiful.</p>

  <p class="quote">“Gadbad teri bike ki seat mein nahi, kahin aur hai.”</p>

  <p>Still stays with me. It made me smile in a way I didn’t expect.</p>

  <p>Coming back to the office after four long hours felt funny, almost unreal.<br>
  Later, meeting you at your home a few times — those moments mattered too.</p>

  <p>But honestly, those office days with you were the best part of my life.<br>
  I felt alive.</p>

  <p>I’m writing this just to let you know — what we shared was real and beautiful.<br>
  And I truly believe there are many more good moments waiting for us ahead.</p>

  <p class="ending">I miss you a lot, buddy.</p>

<hr class="soft-line">
   <p>
    Some meetings change nothing, some change everything, <br>
    You walked in quietly — and the world felt different.
  </p>
  <hr class="soft-line">
  <p>
    Thanks for the gift though, i loved it ❤️.
